# Carlytical (GoldenHacks 4.0)

The Carlytical mobile application is a carbon footprint tracker using Google Maps API location tracking to calculate the total amount of money, carbon emissions, distance, and time you spend each time you drive. This app allows you to conveniently view the amount of money you spend on each car ride you take. Additionally, you can see how much money you've spent on gas collectively at the end of each week and month. This promotes users to be more conscious of how much they spend on driving to encourage more sustainable options such as public transit or biking.

## Inspiration
Reducing air pollution and slowing the effects of climate change while providing users with value.
Application based on the "TD MyAdvantage" Application which tracks users' safety while driving to offer discounts on their car insurance rates. 

Goal: To help students view how much they could save by driving less and using more sustainable modes of transportation.


## How we built it
Our team began by brainstorming ideas to meet the criteria of the challenge while minimizing the churn rate of our application. We listed out our main idea for our application and continuously added new ideas/features onto our application. Secondly, our team split up into two groups. One team focused on learning how to use flutterâ€™s mobile UI framework in order to build the application. The other group focused on coming up with the UX design of the application, adding more features, creating the business proposal script and making our solution more creative for a higher user retention rate. 

 
## Tools and Technologies Used
Figma, Flutter, Andriod Studio, Google Maps Api, Distance Matrix Api
